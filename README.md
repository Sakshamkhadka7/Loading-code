# Simple loader Animation 👼
This is a lightweight,responsive loader animation built purely using HTML and CSS . The animation display three circular dots
that scale in and out in sequence creating a visually appealing loading effect.

# Feature 🪶
**Pure CSS Animation** : No javascript involved
**Responsive web design**: Works well across different screen sizes

# How it works ⚒️ 
The loader consists of three span elements inside a div with the class loader. Each circle (.loader-element) uses slightly delayed
animation to scale up and down using the @keyframe preloader rule.
